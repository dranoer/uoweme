Recently I started reading all documents related to Android Developing on:
https://kotlinlang.org/
https://developer.android.com/

then I decided to make an app to show the power of these new things in Android Development.
This sample app will contains compose, coroutine, hilt etc
I'm gonna add more details related to this open source project step by step.
Happy Coding!
